# Loops
* Terraform offers several different looping constructs, each intended to be used in a slightly different scenario:
    * count parameter, to loop over resources and modules
    * for_each expressions, to loop over resources, inline blocks within a resource, and modules.
    * for expressions, to loop over lists and maps
    * for string directive, to loop over lists and maps within a string
